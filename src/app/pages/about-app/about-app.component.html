    Nature has endowed women with a cycle of the day that repeats every 27
    days.<br /><br />
  </p>
  <p sxpAnimate>
    The application will help you understand and predict the behavior of your
    partner, because most of the changes are caused by hormones that give
    specific symptoms at a given time.
  </p>
  <br /><br />
  <p sxpAnimateRight>
    The Woman Code will tell you when it is safe to make an appointment with
    your friends, and when it is better for you to stay at home with your
    partner and take care of her well-being.

    You will know whether your woman will feel worse. How is this possible? All
    thanks to the study of the hormonal nature and mathematics. When you select
    one of the four, you can see the dates 3 months ahead. Useful right? :)

    Woman Code is also an application for couples who are trying to conceive. As
    you know, in order for sperm cells to connect to the female cell, they must
    be strong, fast and rested. They should be in the right place and time.
    Notifications in the application will remind you 3 days before the date
    calculated based on the research, so that you will know when not to drink
    alcohol, took more physical activity or just take care.
